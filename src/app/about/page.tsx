      <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-neutral-700">
        N0 1IMITS is a personal hub for what I’m building — music, tools,
        data-driven projects, and creative experiments.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        This site exists as a place to share work publicly while giving me room
        to explore ideas privately. Some tools are interactive, some projects
        are still in progress, and some things are simply documentation of the
        process.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
        I’m especially interested in the intersection of music, analytics, and
        culture — whether that’s through DJ mixes, data tools, or experimental
        models like Breakout Radar.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-8 text-neutral-600">
        N0 1IMITS isn’t about perfection or finished products. It’s about
        momentum, curiosity, and building things that feel authentic over time.
